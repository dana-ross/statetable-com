<p>Terms?  Conditions?  A Jedi craves not these things.</p>

<p>Look, the terms are simple.  I built this site because I needed it, and you get to use it, too -- for free!  It would be nice if I could make a few bucks off the ads, but I'm not going to get rich off this.  Google isn't going to buy me out, and I don't forsee a StateTable.com IPO in my future.</p>

<p>Consequently, I make no guarantees this site or its data are accurate.  I'll do my best, but don't sic your legal staff on me when the US decides it doesn't want Kingman Reef anymore.  Also, I can't guarantee any uptime, and I certainly can't guarantee the site will be up tomorrow.  Don't base your business around this site, but feel free to make use of it while it's here.</p>

<p>If you want a warm-fuzzy feeling, remember I'm using this site in my professional life, so I need it to be accurate, too.</p>
