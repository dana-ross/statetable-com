<p>How many times have you been working on a software project and needed a table of states &amp; provinces?  For me, it happens at least every other week.  And, each client has their own idea of which territories are important, so I can't just use the same table for all of them.</p>

<p>I hope you find this site as useful as I do.  Please <a href="mailto:dave@csixty4.com">email me</a> if you have any feedback, or if you have a correction to my data.</p>
